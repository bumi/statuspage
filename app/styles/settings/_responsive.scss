// The variable name `$breakpoints` is used by both Foundation 6 and inuitcss.
// We do not use inuitcss's for responsivity or grids (because it's not maintained)
// So we define it for Foundation here. As we define it, it is even *incompatible* with inuitcss.

// Foundation: https://github.com/zurb/foundation-sites/blob/develop/scss/util/_breakpoint.scss
// Inuit: https://github.com/inuitcss/settings.responsive/blob/master/_settings.responsive.scss
