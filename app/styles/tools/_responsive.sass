// The Foundation 6 "breakpoint" function is a pretty smart media query wrapper.
// You can find it in the vendor directory in the foundation-rails gem
// Or here: https://github.com/zurb/foundation-sites/tree/develop/scss/util

// The breakpoint function depends on some calculation methods found here.
@import foundation/util/unit

// Now we can load the actual function we want to use.
@import foundation/util/breakpoint

// To keep everything flexible, we will only ever call our own wrapper
// Never access Foundation 6 methods directly from your application.
